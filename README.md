# Bulls and Cows Game

This Python script implements the Bulls and Cows game, a classic code-breaking game where the player tries to guess a secret three-digit number. The game provides feedback to help the player refine their guesses.

## Features:

- Generates a random three-digit secret number with unique digits.
- Allows the player to input the number of tries.
- Validates the player's input to ensure it has three unique digits.
- Provides feedback on the correctness of each guess in terms of "cows" and "bulls."
- Congratulates the player upon guessing the number correctly within the specified number of tries.
- Reveals the secret number if the player exhausts all the tries without guessing correctly.

## How to Play:

1. Run the Python script `bulls_and_cows.py`.
2. Input the number of tries you want to have.
3. Enter a three-digit number as your guess.
4. Receive feedback on your guess in terms of "cows" and "bulls."
5. Keep guessing until you either guess the number correctly or exhaust all the tries.

## Requirements:

- Python 3.x
